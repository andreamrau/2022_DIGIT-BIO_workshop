# 2022 DIGIT-BIO workshop: "Do my clusters make sense? Some statistical and biological clues to help..."

<img src="digitbio_logo.png" align="center" />

Unsupervised classification (clustering) is used in many [fields](https://digitbio-ia.github.io/sequences/concepts/s2_clustering). But once a clustering result has been obtained, how can we evaluate its pertinence? In this work, we will work with several statistical and biological indices to reinforce our confidence (or not...) in a clustering result. We will use as an example the identification of co-expressed genes from transcriptomic data with finite mixture models. 

This repo contains all materials for the tutorial. It is organized as follows:

- `biblio/`: folder containing a few helpful and relevant references
- `code/`: folder containing R code contained in the Rmarkdown tutorial
- `data/`: folder containing three `.rds` files that are to be downloaded and loaded in the tutorial R code. These files were generated with the code indicated in the Appendix of the Rmarkdown tutorial
- `doc/`: compiled Rmarkdown tutorial for rendering on Github pages 
- `slides/`: folder containing slides presented during the tutorial.
